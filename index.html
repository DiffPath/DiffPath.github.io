    <h3>
      Accelerated Villous Maturation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Accelerated villous
      maturation is defined as the presence of small or short
      hypermature villi for gestational period, usually accompanied by an increase in syncytial knots.
      By virtue of the use of this phrase, accelerated villous
      maturation may be difficult to recognize in a term placenta,
      but it is a reproducible pattern to diagnose prior to term. It is
      diagnosed by identifying a diffuse pattern of term-appearing
      villi with increased syncytial knots and intervillous fibrin,
      usually alternating with areas of villous paucity.
      Syncytial knot prevalence has been studied at term and
      knots on more than 33% of villi may be regarded as
      increased.
      Areas adjacent to infarcts should not be relied on for the
      diagnosis of accelerated villous maturation.
      Accelerated villous maturation is a common pattern that
      may be found in mild, moderate, or severe forms of
      placental insufficiency, which includes FGR, preeclampsia,
      and preterm labor.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Delayed villous maturation
    </h3>
    <p>
      The lesion is defined by a monotonous villous population
      (defined as at least 10 such villi) with centrally placed
      capillaries and decreased vasculosyncytial membranes,
      recapitulating the histology in early pregnancy.
      The diagnosis should be made when it is present in at least
      30% of 1 full-thickness parenchymal slide.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Proposed Grading Schema</b> — Grading of the lesion is
      suggested at this juncture according to a proposed schema:
      focal, which is a finding of the lesion in 1 full-thickness
      parenchymal slide only, and diffuse, which is a presence in 2
      or more full-thickness slides sampled.
      The thresholds for significance of this lesion are unclear at
      present, and grading the lesion may help determine the
      appropriate levels.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Distal Villous Hypoplasia
    </h3>
    <p>
      Distal villous hypoplasia (DVH) is defined as the
      paucity of villi in relation to the surrounding
      stem villi. The villi are thin and relatively
      elongated-appearing, and syncytial knots are increased.
      Distal villous hypoplasia is more commonly seen with MVM
      in early pregnancy (32 weeks of gestation).
      This is best observed at low-power microscopy and by
      comparing the lower two-thirds of the thickness of the
      parenchyma to the subchorionic third. The
      diagnosis should be made when the features are seen in the
      lower two-thirds and involve at least 30% of 1 full-thickness
      parenchymal slide. It may be further graded as focal—
      finding of lesion in 1 full-thickness slide only—or diffuse—
      present in 2 or more full-thickness slides sampled. Diffuse
      distal villous hypoplasia is associated with early-onset
      FGR.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Chronic Villitis of unknown etiology
    </h3>
    <p>Villitis of unknown etiology (synonymous with villitis of
      unknown aetiology) is a histologic diagnosis and, although
      it may have a variable distribution, evidence indicates that 3
      parenchymal blocks will identify 62% of villitis, reaching an
      asymptote of 6 and 7 blocks identifying 85% of villitis.
      Villitis of unknown etiology by definition excludes those
      cases where an etiology is identified, such as viral or acute
      infections, and thus is preferred to the term nonspecific
      chronic villitis. It is usually lymphohistiocytic: although the
      presence of rare plasma cells does not exclude the diagnosis,
      thorough evaluation for an infectious etiology, such as
      cytomegalovirus, is required in a predominantly plasma cell
      villitis</p>
    <p>
      <b>Grading Schema</b> - Where villitis of unknown etiology is
      diagnosed, it should be graded as low grade or high grade.
      Low grade is defined as the presence of inflammation
      affecting fewer than 10 contiguous villi in any one focus,
      with more than one focus required for the diagnosis. High
      grade is defined as the presence of multiple foci,
      on more than one section, at least one of which shows
      inflammation affecting more than 10 contiguous villi.
      Distinguishing between low-grade and high-grade villitis
      is important because there are significant associations
      between the latter and FGR, neurodevelopmental impairment,
      and likelihood of recurrence.
      Low-grade lesions should be further classified as focal
      when they are seen in one slide, all foci affecting fewer than
      10 villi, with more than one focus required for diagnosis; or
      as multifocal when they are present in more than one slide,
      all foci affecting fewer than 10 contiguous villi. High-grade
      lesions should be further classified as patchy when there are
      multiple foci, with at least one focus with 10 or more
      contiguous villi, and seen in one or more slides; or as diffuse
      when more than 30% of all distal villi are involved.
      Rarely, a single focus of affected villi is seen. In the
      absence of any evidence at present, when the single focus is
      small (10 affected villi) it should be reported as
      ‘‘ungradable–possible low grade,’’ and when the single
      focus contains 10 or more affected villi it should be reported
      as ‘‘ungradable–possible high grade.’’
